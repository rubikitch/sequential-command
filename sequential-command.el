;;; Commentary:

;; Integrating multiple commands into one command is sometimes
;; useful. Pressing C-e at the end of line is useless and adding the
;; other behavior in this situation is safe.
;;
;; For example, defining `my-end': if point is at the end of line, go
;; to the end of buffer, otherwise go to the end of line. Just evaluate it!
;;
;; (define-sequential-command my-end  end-of-line end-of-buffer)
;; (global-set-key "\C-e" 'my-end)
;;
;; Consequently, pressing C-e C-e is `end-of-buffer'!
;;
;; `define-sequential-command' is a macro that defines a command whose
;; behavior is changed by sequence of calls of the same command.
;;
;; `sequential-command-return' is a command to return to the position when sequence
;; of calls of the same command was started.
;;
;; See sequential-command-config.el if you want examples.

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;  `sequential-command-return'
;;    Return to the position when sequence of calls of the same command was started.
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;

;;; Demonstration:

;; Execute M-x sequential-command-demo. And press C-x C-z many times.

;;; Bug Report:
;;
;; If you have problem, send a bug report via M-x sequential-command-send-bug-report.
;; The step is:
;;  0) Setup mail in Emacs, the easiest way is:
;;       (setq user-mail-address "your@mail.address")
;;       (setq user-full-name "Your Full Name")
;;       (setq smtpmail-smtp-server "your.smtp.server.jp")
;;       (setq mail-user-agent 'message-user-agent)
;;       (setq message-send-mail-function 'message-smtpmail-send-it)
;;  1) Be sure to use the LATEST version of sequential-command.el.
;;  2) Enable debugger. M-x toggle-debug-on-error or (setq debug-on-error t)
;;  3) Use Lisp version instead of compiled one: (load "sequential-command.el")
;;  4) Do it!
;;  5) If you got an error, please do not close *Backtrace* buffer.
;;  6) M-x sequential-command-send-bug-report and M-x insert-buffer *Backtrace*
;;  7) Describe the bug using a precise recipe.
;;  8) Type C-c C-c to send.
;;  # If you are a Japanese, please write in Japanese:-)
